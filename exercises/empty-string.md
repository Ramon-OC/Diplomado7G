# Empty String

Create a new String instance called empty and give it an empty string (a string with no characters): let empty = "". It is useful to be able to tell if a string has any characters in it. For example, you may be designing a form for data input and want to prevent the user from submitting a blank entry. Use thestartIndex and endIndex properties on empty to determine whether this string is truly empty.
