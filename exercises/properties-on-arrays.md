## Properties on Arrays

### 1st Part
Look at the array below.
`var toDoList = ["Take out the trash", "Pay bills", "Cross off finished items"] `
Use the documentation to find a property defined on the Array type that will tell you whether toDoList
contains any elements.

### 2nd part
Enter the toDoList array from the bronze challenge in your playground. Use a loop to reverse the order of the elements of this array. Log the results to the console.
Then, examine the Array documentation to see whether there is a more convenient way to do this operation. (There is.)
Finally, use the Array documentation to find an easy way to rearrange the items in your toDoList into a random order.
